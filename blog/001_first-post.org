#+DESCRIPTION: First post about the tech used

This blog has been created using [[https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page][org-page]].
Org-page is a static site generator based on org-mode that allows you
to write and publish blog entries without leaving emacs.

Org-page provides the following features that I will need to explore,
enable and configure:

- Org sources and html files managed by git
- Incremental publication (according to git diff command)
- Category support
- Tags support (auto generated)
- RSS support (auto generated)
- Search engine support (auto generated)
- A beautiful theme
- Theme customization support
- Commenting (implemented using disqus/duoshuo)
- Website traffic analytics (implemented using google analytics)
- Index/about page support (auto generated if no default is provided)
- Highly customizable

Installation seemed to work without problems, but calling the function
=op/new-post= did not work until I upgraded to a development version of
emacs (25.0.50.1).

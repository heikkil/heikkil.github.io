I spent some time looking for a really simple platform for blogging.
Simple in the sense that I can control everything from emacs and do
not have to worry about clicking with a mouse a dozen times to get
something done.
</p>

<p>
I tried <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> and <a href="http://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>, but could not get neither to run easily.
From these experiences I knew I wanted something that worked with <b>org
mode</b> and <b>created static pages</b>. The <a href="https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page">org-page</a> package worked at first
try and fulfilled both requirements. I did have to scrap my first
attempt because I realized I had not understood how org-page works.
The project documentation is sparse so it is easy to get lost. It has been
written by a developer to developers. Let's see if I can spell out
the self-evident.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">How does it work?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
org-page are has three local components, and at least one remote. These are:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>local org-page code base that manages everything, installed in emacs
</li>
<li>local source branch of your web-site
</li>
<li>local master branch generated from source by the code base
</li>
<li>remote master branch serving HTML pages
</li>
<li>(remote source branch)
</li>
</ol>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2015/03/28/understanding-org-page/007-org-page.png" alt="007-org-page.png" />
</p>
</div>


<p>
The optional remote component of source does not really do anything,
but it is a nice way of creating a backup and safeguarding your work.
</p>

<p>
Note that <a href="https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page/issues/113">remote does not have to be in remote computer</a>: You save the
output to any local directory that your web server can see, e.g.
<code>http://localhost/~your_login</code>.
</p>

<p>
By branches we mean branches of a git repository. Everything in
org-page is based on git and you have to have some kind of
understanding of its workings before you can make org-page to do what
you want. Commonly git branches contain files that have at some point
been the same and will at some point be merged back together. Org-page
branches are different. The source branch holds org mode files
that the code base will translate to HTML for publishing. To keep things
simple, you should keep the flow of information one way only.
</p>

<p>
This was my initial stumbling block. I kept switching between the two
branches and did not know what to commit where. In no time the
repository was a complete mess. The code base does not know in which
branch the repository is and does not warn you. It would be great if
it were to know and refuse to touch files in a wrong branch.
</p>

<p>
Starting anew, I was more careful.
</p>

<p>
The whole idea of org-page is that the software can automatically push
the latest updates to the server. It comes with several documented
options of doing it but it has really designed to take advantage of
GitHub's feature that a public repository named {yourlogin}.github.io
is assumed to contain a website is automatically served out at
<a href="http://yourlogin.github.io">http://yourlogin.github.io</a>.
</p>

<p>
That's where your master branch will end up. It needs to contain HTML
source code and a bit of JavaScript supported by CSS that a web server
can make available to the net.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The org-page only has only one maintained theme, mdo. The whole
project is still maintained by one person, Kelvin Hu, and his
site using org-page is all in Chinese. This shows in the design.
Luckily there is <i>a way to add themes</i> and remove some these quirks.
</p>

<p>
I copied the default theme and renamed it to <a href="https://github.com/heikkil/heikkil.github.io/tree/source/themes/sans">sans</a>. This has to be done
in the source branch:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh"><span style="color: #483d8b;">cd</span> (op/repository-directory)
mkdir themes
cp -r .../org-page/themes/mdo themes/sans
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I've tried to change as little as possible. The default font is of
sans serif type rather than a fixed width one. The sans theme headers
start now left of the body text and there is no need to add extra
characters around links or bold text. In Latin text there are standard
ways of rendering these features.
</p>

<p>
The only non-intuitive thing about themes is that its items are kept
in a cache variable that has to be emptied before anything is visibly
changes in the published web pages. More about that later.
</p>

<p>
I've copied over from the mdo theme a recent addition of <b>table of
contents</b>. Note that toc is nil by default in org <code>#+OPTIONS:</code> line of
entry documents and has to be set to 't' for the table of contents to
be generated.
</p>

<p>
In org-page, you are expected to edit the top index page by hand. The
top index.org file is created by the repository creating emacs
functions. You can, however, remove that file for the org-page to
create a listing of written entries. By default, these pages belong to
category blog, and are located in the source sub-directory 'blog'. You
can have more categories by creating new sub-directories and adding
entries into them. You can decide yourself what there categories are
and what kind of articles you store in them. They all share the same
tag namespace and are listed in the same RSS file. Here is <a href="http://www.aurobit.com/">one
installation of org-page using multiple categories</a>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Publish</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Org-page comes with lisp functions that do everything you need to
write and publish a blog.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>op/new-repository</code> \endash interactively fills in repository
details and creates basic files needed
</li>
<li><code>op/new-post</code> \endash adds org headers interactively to a new buffer
</li>
<li><code>op/do-publication</code> \endash interactive, publishes either to local dir or
upstream
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <code>op/new-repository</code> creates files based on your setup. Here is mine:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">require</span> '<span style="color: #008b8b;">org-page</span>)
(setq op/repository-directory <span style="color: #8b2252;">"~/src/org-page/heikkil.github.io"</span>)
(setq op/site-domain <span style="color: #8b2252;">"http://heikkil.github.io"</span>)
(setq op/personal-avatar <span style="color: #8b2252;">"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/75674?v=3&amp;s=460"</span>)
<span style="color: #b22222;">;; </span><span style="color: #b22222;">for commenting; disabled for now</span>
<span style="color: #b22222;">;;</span><span style="color: #b22222;">(setq op/personal-disqus-shortname "your_disqus_shortname")</span>

<span style="color: #b22222;">;; </span><span style="color: #b22222;">analytics set up at ~/.emacs.secrets file</span>
<span style="color: #b22222;">;;</span><span style="color: #b22222;">(setq op/personal-google-analytics-id "UA-NNNNNNNN-N")</span>

(setq op/personal-github-link <span style="color: #8b2252;">"https://github.com/heikkil"</span>)

(setq op/site-main-title <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Heikki @ home"</span>)
(setq op/site-sub-title <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Loose leaves from my tree"</span>)

<span style="color: #b22222;">;; </span><span style="color: #b22222;">set up my own theme since a sans option does not exist</span>
(setq op/theme-root-directory <span style="color: #8b2252;">"~/src/org-page/heikkil.github.io/themes"</span>)
(setq op/theme 'sans)  <span style="color: #b22222;">; </span><span style="color: #b22222;">mdo is the default</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Once all is set up, run <code>op/new-repository</code> to a create basic collection
of files and a git repository in the directory.
</p>

<p>
The <code>op/new-post</code> asks for a name for the entry and creates the file
and org headers for you. Then you just write the content of entry and
publish it. Org mode text gets converted to HTML and pushed to the
remote.
</p>

<p>
The all too self-evident thing that the documentation fails to mention
is that you have to commit your change before it can be published. If
you have several articles under preparation that you have already
added to git, you have to know how to use <code>git stash</code> to store the
unfinished articles while you publish one.
</p>

<p>
The <code>op/do-publication</code> function has five arguments that can be filled
in interactively to publish exactly how you want. To get those
arguments right needs careful concentration. Better automate it. I am
using the <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra">hydra</a> package to help me remember the most important
options. The most common command that I use pushes the last commit to the
remote with <code>C-c p l</code>. Hydra also helps me to clear the cache when
needed with hydra-blog option <code>r</code>.
